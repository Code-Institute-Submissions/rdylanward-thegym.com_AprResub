        -   Montserrat and Lato fonts where initially chosen as the main font to be used alternately throughout the whole website. Montserrat was eventually chosen as the main font as it complimented the design. Sans Serif was chosen as the back-up in the event the main font does not load. A second font was chosen for a future feature (The Gym Blog), 'IM Fell English'. 'IM Fell English' was chosen for it's old style newsprint quality.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Each page, bar the contact page, contains a full-screen header containing a static background image and hero containing a motivational/inspirational quote designed to inspire and motivate a prospective member to join the gym. All of the images are fictional representations of The Gym showing it's staff and members enjoying themselves.
