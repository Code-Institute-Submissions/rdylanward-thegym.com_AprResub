Montserrat was eventually chosen as the main font as it complimented the design. Sans Serif was chosen as the back-up in the event the main font does not load. A second font was chosen for a future feature (The Gym Blog), 'IM Fell English'. 'IM Fell English' was chosen for it's old style newsprint quality.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Each page, bar the contact page, contains a full-screen header containing a static background image and hero containing a motivational/inspirational quote designed to inspire and motivate a prospective member to join the gym. All of the images are fictional representations of The Gym showing it's staff and members enjoying themselves.

-   In landscape view on older and smaller mobile phones, the Home page header does not display properly.
